Task-2
Hotel Reservation Analysis with SQL
In this Project, you will use SQL to answer the questions related to dataset. This will help you to develop
your data analysis skills in a practical context.
Overview:
The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a better guest experience. In
this internship, you will work with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences,
booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel's operations. You will use SQL to query and
analyze the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.
Dataset Details:
The dataset includes the following columns:
 Booking_ID: A unique identifier for each hotel reservation.
 no_of_adults: The number of adults in the reservation.
 no_of_children: The number of children in the reservation.
 no_of_weekend_nights: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on
weekends.
 no_of_week_nights: The number of nights in the reservation that fall on
weekdays.
 type_of_meal_plan: The meal plan chosen by the guests.
 room_type_reserved: The type of room reserved by the guests.
 lead_time: The number of days between booking and arrival.
 arrival_date: The date of arrival.
 market_segment_type: The market segment to which the reservation
belongs.
 avg_price_per_room: The average price per room in the reservation.
 booking_status: The status of the booking.

Task-3
Songs Analysis with Power BI/Tableau
Problem Statement:
This internship project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of YouTube songs data using Power BI.
The dataset contains key attributes such as video ID, channel title, title, description, tags, published date,
view count, like count, favorite count, comment count, video duration, video definition, and caption
details. The goal is to utilize Power BI to create insightful visualizations and reports that provide a deeper
understanding of YouTube songs' performance, popularity, and user engagement. The analysis aims to
uncover trends, preferences, and patterns in the data to aid content creators and stakeholders in
optimizing their YouTube song content.
Dataset Description:
1. video_id: Unique identifier for each YouTube video.
2. channelTitle: Title of the YouTube channel publishing the song.
3. title: Title of the YouTube song video.
4. description: Description provided for the YouTube song video.
5. tags: Tags associated with the YouTube song video.
6. publishedAt: Date and time when the YouTube song video was published.
7. viewCount: Number of views received by the YouTube song video.
8. likeCount: Number of likes received by the YouTube song video.
9. favoriteCount: Number of times the YouTube song video has been marked as a favorite.
10. commentCount: Number of comments posted on the YouTube song video.
11. duration: Duration of the YouTube song video.
12. definition: Video definition or quality (e.g., HD, SD).
13. caption: Availability of captions for the YouTube song video.
Project Objectives:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values or outliers.
- Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Explore patterns and distributions in view counts, like counts, and comments.
- Identify trends in the popularity and engagement of YouTube song videos.
3. Content and Channel Analysis:
- Analyze the distribution of videos across different channels.

- Identify popular tags and their correlation with view counts.
4. Temporal Trends:
- Explore how YouTube song video metrics vary over time.
- Identify peak publishing times and their impact on engagement.
5. User Engagement Insights:
- Investigate relationships between likes, comments, and views.
- Identify factors influencing user engagement with YouTube song videos.
Deliverables:
- Interactive Power BI dashboards showcasing visualizations of YouTube song data trends.
- Reports detailing channel and content analysis, temporal trends, and user engagement insights.
